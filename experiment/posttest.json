      "question": "Why is user authentication considered the first line of defense in database security?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It improves database speed",
        "b": "It verifies user identity before allowing access",
        "c": "It automatically encrypts all data",
        "d": "It manages database backups"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Authentication does not affect performance.",
        "b": "Authentication prevents unauthorized users from accessing the database.",
        "c": "Encryption is a different security mechanism.",
        "d": "Backups are unrelated to authentication."

      "question": "What happens if a user provides correct credentials but the account is locked?",

        "a": "Access is granted immediately",

        "a": "Locked accounts cannot log in.",

      "question": "How do password expiry policies improve database security?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By reducing database size",
        "b": "By forcing users to change passwords periodically",
        "c": "By allowing unlimited login attempts",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Password expiry does not affect storage.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Access should be restricted, not allowed.",

      "question": "Why is observing error messages during failed login attempts important?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase login speed",
        "b": "To understand how authentication mechanisms respond",
        "c": "To change database tables",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Error messages do not affect speed.",

        "a": "Schema design is a separate task.",
